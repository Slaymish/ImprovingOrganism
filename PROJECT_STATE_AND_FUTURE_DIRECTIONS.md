# ImprovingOrganism: Current State & Future Roadmap

## 1. Current State (Post-Refactor Snapshot)

The project is now a resilient, test‑backed "adaptive AI substrate" with a complete feedback loop (generate → evaluate → store → optionally retrain) and graceful degradation when heavy dependencies are absent. Recent work focused on robustness, modularity, and testability rather than raw model scale.

### 1.1 Component Summary

| Layer | Module(s) | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| API | `src/main.py` | Stable | FastAPI endpoints for generation, feedback, stats, self-learning control. |
| LLM Abstraction | `llm_wrapper.py` | Dual-mode | Mock/dev mode vs real model; LoRA hook points present. |
| Memory (Relational) | `memory_module.py` | Robust w/ optional SQLAlchemy | Falls back to in-memory if ORM unavailable; session + tagging implemented. |
| Vector / Semantic Memory | `vector_memory.py` | Optional / pluggable | Weaviate guarded; no-op fallback; not yet integrated into generation context. |
| Latent Workspace & Reasoning | `latent_workspace.py` | Functional | Torch-optional; uncertainty map & goal-directed reasoning; logging & variance stabilization. |
| Evaluation / Critic | `critic_module.py` | Deterministic heuristic | Multi-metric scoring (coherence, novelty, alignment, relevance); lexical + shallow similarity—no embedding critique yet. |
| Training / Updating | `updater.py` / `lora_trainer.py` | Threshold-trigger stubs | Logic for when to fine-tune present; advanced strategies (preference learning) not yet implemented. |
| Safeguards | `training_safeguards.py` | Present | Structural checks; could expand to quantitative drift monitoring. |
| Self-Learning Automation | `self_learning.py` | Operational | Generates prompts & evaluates; currently single-agent, non-adaptive scheduling heuristics. |
| Interfaces / Protocols | `interfaces.py` | Added | PEP 544 protocols (search, vector) enabling dependency injection & easier testing. |
| Dashboard | `dashboard.py` | Basic UI | Offers monitoring & manual control; limited deep analytics. |
| Tests | `tests/unit/*` | Broad coverage | Core logic validated; integration & e2e present; performance / load tests absent. |
| Observability | Logging only | Minimal | No tracing, metrics, or structured event stream. |
| Deployment | Docker + Compose | Working | Multi-service support (API + training). |

### 1.2 Recent Improvements
* Optional dependency guards (torch, sqlalchemy, weaviate, pydantic-settings) with graceful fallback paths.
* Protocol abstraction for semantic search & vector memory.
* Latent workspace refactor: removed fragile runtime type annotations, added uncertainty update stability, logging, and goal flag.
* Memory module: context manager support, semantic search placeholder, vector mirroring hooks.
* Critic scoring tuned for consistency; deterministic outputs for test reliability.
* Warning suppression (protobuf) for cleaner CI signal.
* README & architectural documentation aligned with current capabilities.

### 1.3 Current Limitations
| Area | Limitation | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Contextual Retrieval | Vector store not injected into generation pipeline | Missed opportunities for grounding & alignment. |
| Evaluation Depth | Critic heuristic & lexical | Limited semantic fidelity; novelty coarse. |
| Training Loop | Only threshold-triggered LoRA fine-tune | No preference learning / uncertainty-driven sampling. |
| Uncertainty Use | Tracked but not policy-integrated | Not yet influencing prompt selection or exploration. |
| Data Quality | No automated outlier / toxicity / drift filters | Possible contamination of fine-tuning set. |
| Observability | Lacks metrics (latency, score trends, drift) | Harder to guide optimization & scaling decisions. |
| Safety | Minimal guardrails on generation content | Not production-grade for open deployment. |
| Multi-Agent Reasoning | Single monolithic loop | Limits extensibility for specialization. |
| Test Depth | Few adversarial / load / regression datasets | Unknown robustness envelope. |

### 1.4 Technical Debt / Cleanup Targets
* Centralize scoring weight config (externalize to settings). 
* Consolidate duplicate random seed usage; enforce reproducibility toggle.
* Add structured result object for critic instead of dict with loose keys.
* Introduce abstraction boundary between generation & retrieval (RAG slot).
* Harden updater to skip retraining on low-diversity batches.

## 2. Roadmap (Realistic, Incremental, Impact-Oriented)

### Phase 1 (Immediate / Foundation Hardening)
Focus: Integrate semantic retrieval, tighten data quality, expose observability.
1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Path: (DONE v1)
    * Top-k semantic memories injected into prompt (graceful fallback when unavailable).
    * Retrieval latency + hit metrics recorded.
2. Embedding-Based Critic Extensions: (PARTIAL)
    * Semantic relevance component & metrics recording.
    * Scoring weights externalized to config (ENV override ready).
    * (Next) Replace novelty heuristic with centroid-based distance clusters.
3. Data Hygiene Layer: (PARTIAL)
    * Added rule-based filters (length, repetition, low information) pre-persistence.
    * (Next) Add semantic toxicity / duplication via embeddings.
4. Metrics & Instrumentation: (DONE v1)
    * In-memory metrics module with retrieval + scoring component aggregation.
    * (Next) Expose Prometheus / structured export if needed.
5. Uncertainty Utilization (v1): (PARTIAL)
    * Basic uncertainty → adaptive reasoning step modulation implemented.
    * (Next) Use uncertainty to bias prompt/topic generation.
6. Test Enhancements: (PENDING)
    * Golden critic regression & retrieval integration tests to be added.

### Phase 2 (Adaptive Learning & Preference Feedback)
Focus: Smarter sample selection and model update quality.
1. Preference Pair Generation: (PARTIAL)
    * Variant generation + critic-based ranking implemented (v1).
    * Metrics added (variants, pairs, latency); memory logging of variants.
    * (Next) Diversity controls (temperature/top-p adaptation) & duplicate suppression.
2. Lightweight Preference Optimization:
    * Implement DPO or a simplified logistic preference fine-tune using pairs (fall back to single-example SFT if insufficient pairs).
3. Active Learning Loop:
    * Maintain difficulty & uncertainty buckets; allocate generation budget proportionally.
4. Memory Compression / Clustering:
    * Periodic k-means (or hierarchical) on embeddings to form thematic clusters; store centroids for faster novelty scoring.
5. Adaptive Scheduling:
    * Dynamic iteration pacing: accelerate when recent improvement slope positive; cool down on plateau.

### Phase 3 (Agentic Decomposition & Tooling)
Focus: Modular specialization, extensibility, and reasoning richness.
1. Role Separation:
    * Split into GeneratorAgent, CriticAgent, PlannerAgent, MemoryAgent (interface via message bus / in-process dispatcher).
2. Planner Policy (MVP):
    * Rule-based orchestration: when to retrieve, when to regenerate, when to request critique.
3. Tool Interfaces:
    * Structured tool registry (math evaluator, simple Python exec sandbox, date/time, optionally web search stub).
4. Multi-Stage Reasoning:
    * Introduce an iterative refine loop: draft → critique → patch (bounded iterations, scored each step).
5. Safety Hooks:
    * Content classification pass before persistence & before external response.

### Phase 4 (Robustness, Scaling & Research Extensions)
1. Drift & Regression Monitoring:
    * Statistical tests on rolling score distributions; flag significant degradation.
2. Automated Ablations:
    * Periodic experiments toggling retrieval, uncertainty bias, preference fine-tune to quantify contribution.
3. Hybrid Memory Strategy:
    * Short-term (recent high-velocity buffer) + long-term (cluster centroids + high-impact exemplars) layering.
4. Cost / Resource Awareness:
    * Track GPU time per improvement delta; surface efficiency metric (score gain per training minute).
5. Pluggable Judge LLM (Optional Tier):
    * If external API allowed: integrate secondary evaluator gated behind config; fallback to internal critic.

## 3. Strategic Principles
* Graceful Degradation First: Every advanced feature must no-op elegantly if its dependency absent.
* Determinism for Tests, Stochasticity for Learning: Clear boundary between reproducible pipelines and exploratory sampling.
* Observability as a Feature: No optimizations without metrics; instrumentation precedes tuning.
* Data-Informed Adaptation: Uncertainty + cluster diversity should drive self-learning allocation.
* Incremental Agentification: Avoid over-engineering—introduce agents only when specialization yields measurable gain.

## 4. Prioritized Backlog (Effort → Impact Quick Wins)

## 5. Success Metrics (Initial Suggestions)
| Metric | Definition | Target (First Iteration) |
|--------|------------|--------------------------|
| Retrieval Hit Rate | % generations using ≥1 contextual memory | >60% when vector backend present |
| Novelty Score Stability | Std dev over rolling window | <15% relative variance |
| Improvement Velocity | Slope of average composite score per 100 self-learn samples | Positive & non-zero over 3 windows |
| Preference Utilization | % training batches including preference pairs | >40% after Phase 2 |
| Time-to-Adapt | Wall clock from new feedback to incorporated fine-tune | <30 min (dev env) |
| Failure Rate | Exceptions per 100 generations | <1 |

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Overfitting to heuristic critic | Model optimizes for brittle signals | Introduce embedding & (later) external judge diversity |
| Memory bloat | Unbounded accumulation of low-value entries | Periodic pruning by recency × score × redundancy |
| Silent performance regressions | Changes degrade quality unnoticed | Add rolling statistical alerts & regression tests |
| Preference data scarcity | Insufficient contrasting pairs | Generate forced diversity variants; adaptive temperature |
| Tool execution risk | Sandbox misuse / infinite loops | Timeout + resource limits + whitelist |

## 7. Recommended Next Sprint Scope (Concrete)
1. Add retrieval injection layer (RAG context builder) + tests.
2. Implement embedding-based novelty & relevance in critic (flag to toggle).
3. Stand up metrics collector (simple in-memory + /stats extension) and log emission.
4. Wire uncertainty-driven prompt selection (top-N high entropy topics → prompt generator bias).
5. Add regression test fixtures capturing pre-change composite scores for a fixed seed corpus.

Deliverable: Demonstrable uplift in composite relevance & alignment on a fixed evaluation set with retrieval ON vs OFF.
